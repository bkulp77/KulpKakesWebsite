# Project 3 Retrospective
## 1. What went well?
* Website views well from going to public link.
* Finished on time despite challenges.
* I learned a lot about how websites are created.
* I have a start to the website if my wife ends up doing the business.
## 2. What could be improved?
* I could have tried to learn more ways to tweak the style to make it look more professional.
* I spent a lot of time trying to figure out why my pictures weren't showing up on the GitHub public site when they showed up on Visual Studio Code and ultimately found out that I didn't have the "." before the folder name so it could properly map the pictures.
