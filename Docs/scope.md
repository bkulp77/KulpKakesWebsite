# Kulp Kakes Website
## Project Purpose
My wife Candi wants to start a baking business and has just been doing requests
through word of mouth. Having her own website would allow her to reach more people
and display what she has to offer for her baking business.
## Description
* Basic website to show some of her baking creations and what kind of baked goods
would be available.
* An about section that shows the story behind how Candi started the business and
her background.
## Desired Results
* Increase visibility to Candi's business by 50%.
* Increase cupcake orders by 40%.
* Reduce time from emailing samples of previous creations to potential customers by
30% since samples will be posted to the website.
## Exclusions
Not to include an online ordering system at this time, will be created in future
iterations of the website.
## Feedback Loops
Candi along with friends and family.
## People Resources
