        <h1>Candi Kulp</h1>
            <h2>Our Story</h2>
        
        <p>Candi is a 25 year Navy veteran .<p>

        <p>When I retire from my Navy civilian career, I would like to use the degree to do some part time work in retirement, 
            whether it would be as a contractor or start my own business doing computer repair and or website creation.  I won't 
            be in a position that I have to work due to my Navy active duty and civilian retirements, but I would like to continue
            to have a purpose and work part time.</p>
