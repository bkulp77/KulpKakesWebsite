        <h1>Candi Kulp</h1>
            <h2>Our Story</h2>
        
        <p>I’m Candi, a recently retired U.S. Navy veteran with over 25 years of dedicated service. After an hard but rewarding career serving our country, I transitioned into civilian life ready for a new chapter. My next chapter is centered around my passion for baking, cooking and creating joy through food.
While in the Navy, I learned the value of discipline, teamwork, and attention to detail, skills that now fuel every aspect of my work in the kitchen. Eager to build a strong foundation for my next venture, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Business Administratio from Liberty University, where I gained the knowledge in management, finance, and entrepreneurship needed to turn a dream into a thriving business.
To hone my craft and take my baking to a professional level, I attended The Culinary School of Fort Worth, where I was an honor graduate and gained experience with hands-on training in baking, pastry techniques, and the art of creating delicious, beautifully crafted desserts.
I’m excited to launch my own business specializing in custom cupcakes, cakes and desserts that are all organic. Whether you want a classic vanilla cupcake with perfect buttercream, an elegant layered cake for a special occasion, or something uniquely personalized, I put all my energy into every creation to make it memorable and somthing unique. My goal is simple: to make people smile, celebrate milestones, and make everyday moments a little sweeter.
Thank you for supporting a veteran and women owned small business. I can’t wait to bake something special for you!.<p>

        <p
